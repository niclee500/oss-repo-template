Choosing a liscense is important because it is a way of telling people what they can/cannot do with your code. If it were not liscensed, then no one has permission to use/modify your code. Hence, if people wanted to contribute, a liscense is needed.


You should not use a project that does not have a liscense because you do not have permission to use/modify the code.
