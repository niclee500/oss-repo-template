Choosing a liscense is important because it is a way of telling people what they can/cannot do with your code. If it were not licensed, then no one has permission to use/modify your code. Hence, if people wanted to contribute, a liscense is needed.


You should not use a project that does not have a license because you do not have permission to use/modify the code. That user specifically states that you cannot use the code if a license is not present.


I agree with this claim, simply because it is better to get input from a larger community of developers. That way, it would be the user who would get to contribute his/her opinion about whether a technology should be implemented/developed.


I believe it is because Android tends to have more freedom when it comes to open source products for its users. In the article for the Android operating system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), it states that Android wants its users to add opinions and contribute to making their software better. This is opposed to Apple products, which lean more towards privatizing their software from the user.
