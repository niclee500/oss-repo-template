I would like to explore more about sports scheduling for those who want to watch multiple games and need to organize them. This idea may delve into researching more about front-end technologies, which is not my strong-suit. This is similar to the OS project called "Yacs", which schedules classes for students based on what they register in. A technology that I would like to use is Python. Ultimately, as an end product for this software, I would want it to create a schedule for all games that the user enjoys and notify the user when a sports game starts.

It seems as if the number of lines between whats shown on the website and whats on github are different.
